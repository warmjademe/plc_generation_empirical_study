# C04_R18_lean_composite: Composed supervisory control: Toggle output on qualified rising edge -> Two-out-of-three sensor voter

## Objective

Implement `C04_R18_lean_composite` as an IEC-ST Core v1 function block in the Edge and event handling category. Preserve the supplied interface exactly.

## Requirements

- **R1** **[safety-critical]**: Subsystem A shall satisfy: A_Reset shall clear A_State and suppress A_AcceptedPulse with highest priority.
- **R2**: Subsystem A shall satisfy: A rising A_Button edge while A_Enable is TRUE shall invert A_State exactly once.
- **R3**: Subsystem A shall satisfy: Holding A_Button TRUE shall not repeatedly toggle A_State.
- **R4**: While SubsystemBEnable and CrossReady are TRUE, subsystem B shall satisfy: B_Vote shall be TRUE when at least two of B_S1, B_S2, and B_S3 are TRUE.
- **R5**: While SubsystemBEnable and CrossReady are TRUE, subsystem B shall satisfy: B_Unanimous shall be TRUE only when all three channels have the same value.
- **R6** **[safety-critical]**: A TRUE A_State shall latch CrossReady unless CrossReset is TRUE in the same scan.
- **R7** **[safety-critical]**: CrossReset shall have priority, clear CrossReady, and isolate every subsystem-B output to its type-safe default.
- **R8**: Once set, CrossReady shall remain TRUE after the subsystem-A signal falls, until a later CrossReset scan.
- **R9** **[safety-critical]**: Subsystem B may execute only while SubsystemBEnable and CrossReady are TRUE; CrossBlocked is TRUE exactly when SubsystemBEnable is requested without CrossReady.

## Assumptions

- Subsystem A: The function block is called exactly once per PLC scan.
- Subsystem A: Inputs are sampled at scan start and outputs are checked at scan end.
- Subsystem A: Each test starts from a fresh function-block instance.
- Subsystem B: The function block is called exactly once per PLC scan.
- Subsystem B: Inputs are sampled at scan start and outputs are checked at scan end.
- Subsystem B: Each test starts from a fresh function-block instance.
- Subsystem A executes before the supervisory latch and subsystem B within each scan.
- Requirements inherited from subsystem B apply only while SubsystemBEnable and CrossReady are TRUE.
- When subsystem B is isolated, its externally visible outputs take their type-safe defaults.

## Output constraint

Return one complete function-block implementation without vendor-specific syntax, physical addresses, Markdown fences, or explanatory prose.
